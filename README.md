# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
Building a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.
# Summary
Building an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, I started with data wrangling and handling the missing data, next applied some preprocessing techniques and  feature engineering, then used 5 machine learning, lastly tuned the beat models and choosed the best estimator. Accuracy 87%,f1-score 88%
